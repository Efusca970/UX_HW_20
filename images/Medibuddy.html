<h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT </h4>
<h5> Problem: Many users struggle to manage their medicine and vitamins on a daily basis often leading to incorrect or even missed doses. 
Solution: We believe by designing an application that assists the users with their daily medication and vitamin routine, we can also offer a healthier way of living. Make Medibuddy your gentle reminder buddy.

<h4>Interview plan</h4>
	<h5> We started our interview plan with 3 interviews to help discover what concerns users faced when taking their daily medications, vitamins and supplements. We discovered that many users tended to forget and even missed dosage. 
We surveyed 91 participants, aging from 20-60 years old, to gain a broader perspective on their daily medication, and vitamin routines.
• Remind them of doses
 • Refills of prescriptions
 • Discounts of medications
 • Correct and clear instructions
Doing this will give our users options to help keep their medication routine on track.
